# Feature Specification: macOS Game Engine

**Feature Branch**: `001-macos-game-engine`
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Write a game engine for Mac OS"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Basic Scene Rendering (Priority: P1)

Game developers can create a simple 2D game scene with sprites and render it to the screen at a smooth frame rate. This represents the core rendering loop that all games require.

**Why this priority**: Without the ability to display graphics on screen, no game can function. This is the foundational capability that defines a game engine.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a scene with multiple sprites, running the engine, and verifying sprites appear on screen at 60 FPS or higher.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an empty game project, **When** developer creates a scene with 5 sprite objects and starts the engine, **Then** all 5 sprites render correctly on screen
2. **Given** a running game scene, **When** developer measures frame rate, **Then** frame rate maintains 60 FPS or higher with up to 100 sprites
3. **Given** a game window, **When** developer resizes the window, **Then** scene content scales appropriately and continues rendering smoothly

### User Story 2 - Entity Management and Game Loop (Priority: P2)

Game developers can add, remove, and update game entities with custom behavior through a standard game loop (update/render cycle). Entities can have properties, behaviors, and interact with each other.

**Why this priority**: Once basic rendering works, developers need to create interactive game objects with behavior. This is essential for any game logic.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating entities with update methods that modify their properties over time, and verifying changes persist across frames.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a running game scene, **When** developer adds an entity with position and velocity properties, **Then** entity position updates each frame based on velocity
2. **Given** multiple entities in a scene, **When** developer removes one entity, **Then** removed entity no longer renders or updates
3. **Given** a game entity, **When** developer defines custom update logic, **Then** custom logic executes every frame during the update cycle

---

### User Story 3 - Input Handling (Priority: P3)

Game developers can respond to keyboard and mouse input events to create interactive gameplay. Input events are processed each frame and can trigger entity behaviors.

**Why this priority**: Basic rendering and entity management create a foundation, but player interaction makes it a game. This enables the first truly playable experiences.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by binding keyboard keys to entity movement and verifying entities respond correctly to input in real-time.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a controllable entity, **When** player presses arrow keys, **Then** entity moves in the corresponding direction
2. **Given** a running game, **When** player clicks mouse on screen, **Then** game receives click coordinates and can respond to the event
3. **Given** multiple input sources active, **When** player uses keyboard and mouse simultaneously, **Then** both input types are processed correctly without conflicts

---

### User Story 4 - Asset Loading and Management (Priority: P4)

Game developers can load image files (PNG, JPEG) and use them as sprite textures. The engine manages asset lifecycle and provides efficient access to loaded assets.

**Why this priority**: While initial testing can use colored rectangles, real games need image assets. This enables visual polish and authentic game development.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by loading an image file from disk, applying it to a sprite, and verifying the image appears correctly on screen.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an image file path, **When** developer loads the asset, **Then** image becomes available as a texture for sprites
2. **Given** multiple sprites using the same texture, **When** engine renders the scene, **Then** texture is loaded once and shared efficiently
3. **Given** an invalid file path, **When** developer attempts to load asset, **Then** engine reports a clear error message without crashing

---

### User Story 5 - Basic Physics and Collision Detection (Priority: P5)

Game developers can define simple bounding boxes for entities and detect when entities collide with each other. This enables gameplay mechanics like collecting items or detecting hits.

**Why this priority**: Many games require collision detection for core mechanics. This enables a wide range of gameplay patterns without requiring complex physics.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating two moving entities with bounding boxes and verifying collision events fire when they overlap.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** two entities with bounding boxes, **When** entities overlap on screen, **Then** collision event fires with references to both entities
2. **Given** a moving entity, **When** entity moves away from another entity, **Then** collision stops being detected
3. **Given** multiple entities in a scene, **When** checking for collisions, **Then** only overlapping pairs trigger collision events

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the game window is minimized or moved to a background workspace?
- How does the engine handle very large numbers of entities (1000+) while maintaining frame rate?
- What happens when attempting to load assets while the game loop is running?
- How does the engine behave when system resources are limited (low memory, CPU throttling)?
- What happens when a game entity's update logic throws an error or takes too long to execute?
- How does input handling work during frame rate drops or system lag?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-002**: Engine MUST maintain a target frame rate of 60 FPS for scenes with up to 100 entities
- **FR-003**: Engine MUST support 2D sprite rendering with position, rotation, and scale transformations
- **FR-004**: Engine MUST provide a game loop with separate update and render phases
- **FR-005**: Engine MUST allow developers to add, remove, and query entities during gameplay
- **FR-006**: Engine MUST support loading image files in common formats (PNG, JPEG) as textures
- **FR-007**: Engine MUST provide keyboard and mouse input event handling
- **FR-008**: Engine MUST support basic collision detection using rectangular bounding boxes
- **FR-009**: Engine MUST allow entities to have custom update behavior defined by developers
- **FR-010**: Engine MUST provide coordinate system with origin and orientation appropriate for 2D games
- **FR-011**: Engine MUST handle graceful shutdown when game window closes

### Key Entities

- **Game Scene**: Represents a game level or screen, contains all entities and manages the game loop lifecycle
- **Entity**: A game object that exists in the scene, has properties (position, rotation, scale), and can have custom behavior
- **Sprite**: A visual representation component that can be attached to entities, references a texture
- **Texture**: An image asset loaded from disk that can be applied to sprites
- **Transform**: Position, rotation, and scale information that determines how an entity appears in the world
- **Input Event**: Keyboard or mouse action that occurred, includes event type and relevant data (key code, mouse position)
- **Bounding Box**: Rectangular collision volume defined by position and dimensions
- **Game Loop**: The core cycle that updates entity logic and renders frames at the target frame rate

- **SC-003**: Asset loading completes in under 100ms for typical game images (under 5MB)
- **SC-004**: Input latency from key press to entity response is under 16ms (one frame at 60 FPS)
- **SC-005**: 90% of common game development tasks (create entity, add sprite, handle input) require 5 lines of code or fewer
- **SC-006**: Collision detection between all entity pairs completes within the frame budget (16ms) for scenes with up to 50 collidable entities

- Developers have basic programming experience with Go
- Primary use case is 2D games, not 3D rendering
- Initial scope focuses on desktop gaming, not mobile
- Engine will be used for indie/hobby game development, not AAA production
- Standard desktop hardware (8GB RAM, integrated graphics or better)
- Single-threaded game loop is acceptable for initial release
- Audio support is explicitly out of scope for this initial version
- Networking/multiplayer features are out of scope for initial version
- No built-in physics engine beyond basic collision detection
- Target game complexity is simple to medium arcade-style games and platformers
