# Specification Quality Checklist: macOS Game Engine

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality - PASS
- Specification describes capabilities from game developer perspective
- No mention of specific Go packages, frameworks, or implementation approaches
- Focus on what the engine enables developers to do
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

### Requirement Completeness - PASS
- All requirements are clear and testable
- FR-015 originally had [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] but resolved to RGBA with alpha transparency (standard for modern 2D engines)
- Success criteria include specific metrics (60 FPS, 100ms load time, 16ms input latency)
- Success criteria avoid implementation details (focus on developer experience and performance)
- 5 user stories with comprehensive acceptance scenarios
- 6 edge cases identified covering system events, performance limits, and error conditions
- Scope clearly defined in Assumptions section (2D only, no audio, no networking)
- Assumptions section documents all dependencies and constraints

### Feature Readiness - PASS
- Each functional requirement maps to user stories and acceptance scenarios
- User stories progress from P1 (core rendering) to P5 (collision detection)
- P1 alone (Basic Scene Rendering) provides a working MVP
- Success criteria are measurable without implementation knowledge
- No leakage of technical decisions into specification

## Notes

All checklist items passed. The specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` phase.

**Key Decisions Made**:
1. Resolved color format to RGBA with alpha transparency (industry standard for 2D engines)
2. Defined target game complexity as simple to medium arcade-style games and platformers (added to Assumptions)
3. These decisions enable concrete planning without requiring user clarification
